"""Checks that every file of a release is in the stores with all its Minecraft versions and loaders.

Usage: check-stores.py <tag> [--warn-only]

The expected files come from the publish matrix in .github/workflows/publish.yml, so the two cannot
drift apart. Modrinth is read from its public API; CurseForge from api.cfwidget.com, which mirrors
the public file list (the CurseForge API itself needs a key we do not have, and the upload token
cannot list files). cfwidget refreshes a project every few minutes, so a check right after an
upload can miss the newest files.

A Markdown table goes to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY; every gap is reported as an error (a warning with
--warn-only) and makes the script exit 1.
